# Windows Hello


Microsoft Windows Hello, part of Windows 10, gives users a personal, secured experience where the device is authenticated based on their presence. Users can log in with a look or a touch, with no need for a password. In conjunction with Microsoft Passport, biometric authentication uses fingerprints or facial recognition and is more secure, more personal, and more convenient.

<td><p>Windows Hello works with the [Companion Device Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/companion-device-unlock) to enhance the user authentication experience. Using the Windows Hello companion device framework, a companion device can provide a rich experience for Windows Hello even when biometrics are not available (e.g., if the Windows 10 desktop lacks a camera for face authentication or fingerprint reader device, for example).</p></td>

Windows Hello face authentication utilizes a camera specially configured for near infrared (IR) imaging to authenticate and unlock Windows devices as well as unlock your Microsoft Passport.</p></td>
