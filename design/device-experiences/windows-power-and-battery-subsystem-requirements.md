# Windows power and battery subsystem requirements


To meet user expectations and provide a quality experience, all Windows PCs must have consistent behavior for battery charging and system power transitions. Starting with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, this design principle extends to battery-powered hardware platforms that are based on System on a Chip (SoC) integrated circuits and that support the modern standby power model.

This section describes the user experience requirements for the power and battery charging subsystem in a hardware platform that runs Windows. It provides detailed implementation guidance for platform designers and firmware developers. They can use this information to ensure their platforms are compatible with Windows power management software.

The information in this section pertains to all processor architectures—x86, x64, and ARM—that are supported by Windows. In addition, this information applies both to low-power platforms that implement the modern standby power model and to platforms that support the traditional ACPI sleep (S3) and hibernate (S4) power states.
