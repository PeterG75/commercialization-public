# Tools available


You can use tools that are available for Windows 8.1 Connected Standby to evaluate a Modern Standby system. New flags are being added to help track whether a particular system that is returning data had the network stack up or not while in Standby mode. Some of the labels may be incorrect (for example, MS sessions identified as CS sessions). Please file bugs as issues are found.
