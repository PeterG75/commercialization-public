This room definition is based on the [ETSI ES 202 396-1 : Section 6](http://aka.ms/es202-396-1) specification, with slight modifications that include a reduced upper limit for reverberation time.  Reverberation time can be reduced through the installation of removable or fixed absorptive (i.e. acoustic foam) panels covering reflective surfaces.

For tests performed against **Device.Audio.Acoustics**, an anechoic chamber is recommended.


### Test Room Setup Topology

The required test setup is shown below:

**Top View:**

![test room setup topology](../images/speechplatform-test-room-setup-topology.png)

**DUT Position** is 30cm above the center of the table, while maintaining a 2m distance from each BGN speaker.

The side view of BGN test setup and microphone calibration position (i.e. "DUT Position" is shown below):

![side view of bgn test setup and microphone calibration position](../images/speechplatform-dut-position.png)

Consult the manufacturer specifications to determine the acoustic center of BGN loudspeakers.

### Verify Mouth Simulator Level @ DUT Position

Each test scenario in the speech platform specification has a defined talker level at MRP.  In order to ensure lab alignment with the specification and room requirements, an additional verification step will calibrate the level of the mouth simulator at the DUT Position.

Adjust the talker level at the MRP, and then verify at the DUT position.  Adjust the mouth simulator level at the DUT position accordingly to match the results in the "Step 2" column in the table below:

| **Category**         | **Step 1: Verify Talker Level @ MRP** | **Step 2: Verify (and Adjust) Talker Level @ DUT Position** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Near Field, 0.5m** | 89 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                     | 68 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                                           |
| **Near Field, 0.8m** | 89 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                     | 62 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                                           |
| **Far Field, 2m**    | 95 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                     | 63 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                                           |
| **HMD**              | 89 ± 0.5 dBSPL(A)                     | N/A                                                         |

If the results in Step 2 are very different than the requirements in the table above, ensure that the mouth simulator has been appropriately equalized and calibrated by the equipment manufacturer, and ensure that the requirements for the test room in Section 2 are met.



### Adjust Echo Playback Level @ Listener Reference Position

Each device scenario in the speech platform specification has a defined level and listener reference position for calibrating the level of echo playback.

Position the measurement microphone at the LRP, as shown in Section 5.

Echo is calibrated by playing back the file EchoCalibration.wav on a device for 30s, and measured using LA<sub>eq</sub> (dBSPL(A)).

| **Category**         | **Listener Reference Position (LRP)** | **Echo Level, dBSPL(A)\*** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Near Field, 0.5m** | 0.5m                                  | 70                         |
| **Near Field, 0.8m** | 0.8m                                  | 70                         |
| **Far Field, 2m**    | 0.8m                                  | 70                         |
| **HMD**              | HATS Right Ear DRP**                  | 76                         |
\***NOTE:** devices that cannot meet 70 dB(A) @ LRP must be set to max. volume and be ≥ 64 dB(A) to pass.

\*\***NOTE:** No correction filters shall be applied (e.g. DRP/ERP, Diffuse Field, Free Field, ID, etc.)



## <a href="" id="section-5-test-positions"></a>SECTION 5 | TEST POSITIONS

**The DUT shall be placed relative to the MRP and LRP, during all tests, in what is deemed to be a typical ("normal") scenario/use case.  However, the minimum distance for a typical tablet/laptop is to be 50cm.**

The IHV owns the scenarios for their device. The recommendations here are intended to provide the IHV with guidelines to validate their device against speech recognition functionality. _Each device only needs to be evaluated against one chosen test position and associated requirements (near field standard, near field premium or far field premium)_, though IHVs may find use in experimenting with various positions.

Scenario definition includes considerations like the following:

-	Distance of MRP to microphone (array)
-	Orientation of MRP to microphone (array)
-	Placement of the boom arm on headset devices
-	Coverage/pressure of the earpiece(s) on the ear simulators for headset devices 
-	Location of loudspeaker(s) relative to the microphones and HATS
-	Device placement environment e.g. on a table, in free air, on a TV, on a HATS

For additional guidance on typical device usage modality and test setups, reference Section 5 in the Skype / Lync Audio Specification [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788953](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788953)



### Standard Near Field (0.5m) Test Positions


Laptop or similar devices shall be positioned on a tabletop surface relative to MRP as shown below:

![](../images/spd-test-image009.png)

For webcam devices tested as standard near field category, the following setup shall be used, with the constraint that the height of the monitor that the webcam rests upon is no taller than 50cm and the webcam is centered in its typical resting position on top of the screen (e.g. a 27" monitor is recommended):

![](../images/spd-test-image010.png)

In order to test echo scenarios, stereo speakers are required.  However, they must not be separated any further than 76cm from inner edge to inner edge.  For best results, low distortion, high bandwidth speakers (e.g. Neumann KH120) are recommended that are driven by a test PC with a low latency interface (e.g. Surface Pro 4 headset jack "line out" to self-powered speakers such as the Neumann KH120).  The SDNR recommendations as described in Audio.Acoustics within the Speech Platform Recommendations may be used to assess suitability for measurement.

![](../images/spd-test-image011.png)



### Premium Near Field (0.8m) Test Positions

When choosing to test laptops against the premium near-field specification, the test setup shall be as below, with the test distance of 80cm aligned with the hinge fulcrum of the laptop/detachable PC:

![](../images/spd-test-image012.png)

All-in-One or Desktop PCs with integrated microphone arrays shall be tested at a distance of 80cm from MRP and LRP to the front of the display, on a table as shown below:

![](../images/spd-test-image013.png)

For webcam devices tested as premium near field category, the following setup shall be used, with the constraint that the height of the monitor that the webcam rests upon is no taller than 50cm and the webcam is centered in its typical resting position on top of the screen (e.g. a 27" monitor is recommended):

![](../images/spd-test-image014.png)

In order to test echo scenarios, stereo speakers are required.  However, they must not be separated any further than 76cm from inner edge to inner edge.  For best results, low distortion, high bandwidth speakers (e.g. Neumann KH120) are recommended that are driven by a test PC with a low latency interface (e.g. Surface Pro 4 headset jack "line out" to self-powered speakers such as the Neumann KH120).  The SDNR recommendations as described in Audio.Acoustics within the Speech Platform Recommendations may be used to assess suitability for measurement.  

![](../images/spd-test-image015.png)




### Head Mounted Devices

An ITU-T P.58 compliant HATS is recommended for testing Head Mounted Devices (HMDs).  

Headsets and Head Mounted Devices will be placed on HATS and adjusted to resemble, as closely as possible, the positioning on a real human. For movable microphones (e.g. "booms"), the microphone should be placed as close as the design will reasonably allow to MRP.

For headset devices, the earpiece should be coupled with the HATS ear in a typical wearing position with an effort to center the earpiece over the drum reference point and maintain a seal around the pinna.

![](../images/spd-test-image016.png)

For Virtual/Augmented Reality devices, the device should be placed as per a normal wearing position.  It is recommended that the tester provide a means of documenting or marking the wearing position on HATS as to ensure repeatability.

![](../images/spd-test-image017.png)



### Premium Far Field (4m) Devices


Far field (i.e. 4m) devices such as integrated mic arrays in a screen device, mic arrays which sit on top of a screen or surface shall be tested as shown below, with the test distance from MRP and LRP to the front plane of the screen or mic array at 4m:

![](../images/spd-test-image018.png)

The specification defines test cases for devices intended for use in far field (i.e. 4m) conditions.  As many test environments may not be sufficiently large to test in 4m, a 2m test distance can be used with test signals/levels adjusted to simulate a 4m test distance as described.  The test setup when using the 2m (simulated 4m) test setup is simply modified as below:

![](../images/spd-test-image019.png)



### FA Test Setup Topology

The recommended setup for conducting false accept (FA) testing is illustrated in the diagram below.  The device is centered in the table as described per device categories in previous sections:

![](../images/spd-test-image020.png)

![](../images/spd-test-image021.png)

 

## <a href="" id="section-6-measurement-procedure"></a>SECTION 6 | MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE

The following section contains the procedure to for testing a device against the **Device.SpeechRecognition** and **Device.VoiceActivationOEM** recommendations.



### Preparing for testing

The **OEMverificationx86** application is a tool that indicates which test script the system is currently configured to use. The tool is used as follows:

1. Copy the files from the toolchain folder _"SpeechPlatform-OnLabPC"_ to the test room Lab PC.
2. Copy the files from the toolchain folder _"SpeechPlatform-OnDevice"_ to the DUT PC.
3. Install the score utility (see Appendix B) on an x64 Win8.x/Win10 machine (not the DUT PC).
4. Ensure test equipment is set up as described in Section 2.
5. Ensure test equipment is calibrated as described in Section 3.
6. Ensure the test signal levels are set appropriately for the desired test scenario as described in Section 4.
7. Position the device under test as described in Section 5.
8. Ensure that the device under test is configured with the correct and intended geometry descriptor information, default processing pipeline, and default mic gain. See the Speech Platform Input Device Recommendations 



### Device.SpeechRecognition | Test Procedure

1. Mute the output channels for each scenario as described in the table below
2. On the DUT PC, run **SpeechRecordings.cmd _foldername_**, where *_foldername_* is a user-specified unique session for each iteration of a scenario described in the table below.
3. On the Lab PC, play back SpeechTalkerAndAmbient.wav within ~3s of starting the recording
4. For ECHO SCENARIOS ONLY, play back Echo.wav on the DUT PC.

**NOTE: Echo playback must not start until 1-2s after the alignment chirp plays back from the speech input file!**

| **Scenario**   | **Lab PC Output Channels MUTED** | **DUT Echo File Playback**             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Quiet**      | 3-6                              | No                                     |
| **Noise**      | None                             | No                                     |
| **Echo**       | 3-6                              | Yes, 1-2s after Talker Alignment Chirp |
| **Echo+Noise** | None                             | Yes, 1-2s after Talker Alignment Chirp |

Note: The script **ScriptRecordings.cmd** is used to capture the default processed data from the device. For OEMs who wish to conduct experiments for offline processing on unprocessed data, the script **RawRecordings.cmd** is provided. Unprocessed data should not be scored and evaluate against this specification.



### Device.SpeechRecognition | Generating Test Results

1. Create a folder where the scoring results output shall be saved
2. From that folder, open a command prompt
3. Type **score _parent foldername_**, where _parent foldername_ contains individual session sub-folders to be scored
 


### Preparing DUT for Device.VoiceActivationOEM

The following additional steps must be followed to prepare a device for Device.VoiceActivationOEM testing:

1. Set up the DUT PC with Cortana signed in to a test account
2. Enable "Hey Cortana" in settings
3. Ensure that the system language settings are set to EN-US English



### Device.VoiceActivationOEM | Test Procedure

1. Mute the output channels for each scenario as described in the table below
2. On the DUT PC, under an Admin-level command prompt, run **KWSCapture-EnUS.cmd _foldername_**, where _foldername_ is a user-specified unique session for each iteration of a scenario described in the table below.
3. On the Lab PC, play back **KWSTalkerAndAmbient.wav** within ~3s after the command prompt displays: 
> `Capturing for 625 seconds...`
4. For _ECHO SCENARIOS ONLY_, play back **Echo.wav** on the DUT PC.

**NOTE: Echo playback must not start until 1-2s after the alignment chirp plays back from the speech input file!**

| **Scenario**   | **Lab PC Output Channels MUTED** | **DUT Echo File Playback**             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Quiet**      | 3-6                              | No                                     |
| **Noise**      | None                             | No                                     |
| **Echo**       | 3-6                              | Yes, 1-2s after Talker Alignment Chirp |
| **Echo+Noise** | None                             | Yes, 1-2s after Talker Alignment Chirp |



### Device.VoiceActivationOEM | Generating Test Results

1. Create a folder where the scoring results output shall be saved
2. From that folder, open a command prompt
3. Type **score _parent foldername_**, where _parent foldername_ contains individual session sub-folders to be scored

## <a href="" id="appendix-b-toolchain"></a>Appendix B | TOOLCHAIN

The following appendix provides detailed information for executable and script components provided in the Speech Platform toolchain.  

All stimulus and calibration .wav files provided in the toolchain are described in Section 4 of this document.




### System Requirements

The device under test must be running Windows 10 with the Creators Edition Update or newer.

To verify the version of Windows, press Windows Key + R, and execute "winver.exe".

The OS build version must be 15004.XXXX or newer.



### Determining Configuration: OEM or Microsoft Processing

Starting with the Windows Creators Edition update, the Speech category stream is guaranteed to have audio processing (e.g. echo cancellation, noise suppression, adaptive gain control).

Audio processing is provided by either:

1. The new in-box Microsoft AEC APO
2. OEM/IHV Technology

If a provided audio driver:

- Supports Speech mode, and
- Enumerates Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) and Noise Suppression (NS) as DSP effects, and
- Has valid microphone geometry (if the capture stream has >1 channel)

then OEM/IHV processing will be used, and the in-box Microsoft Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) APO will be inserted at the end of the OEM\IHV Processing.

Otherwise, the in-box Microsoft AEC APO will be used for processing.

To determine the current state of the device under test:

1. Run **OEMVerification.exe** from the Speech Platform Toolchain on the DUT PC.
2. If the MS pipeline is configured as default "MS Processing Expected to be used" will be returned
3. If the OEM pipeline is configured as default "OEM Processing Expected to be used" will be returned

### Hardware Developer Center

For ease of uploading results to the Hardware Developer Center (https://sysdev.microsoft.com), it is recommended that the folder name provided to the recording script be descriptive of the run, e.g.:

`SpeechRecordings.cmd 10Min-EchoCancellation`

This will make the results clearer to your representative. 



### Scoring Utility

Installation details for the Score Utility are provided in the readme.txt with the installer.

To score recorded sessions:

1. Store the output folders of the previously provided recorded utility in a central folder *_FOO_*
2. In a user mode CMD window, create a new directory *_Test Output Folder_*
3. cd *_Test Output Folder_*
4. score *_Full Path to FOO_*

A run and score will be provided for each recorded output subfolder under <FOO> and will be in the folder output *_Test Output Folder_*.

Note: it is strongly recommended to use a naming convention that reflects the scenario of each recording, e.g.:

- PrototypeDevice-2m-Quiet-50degrees
- HeadsetABC-HMD-NoiseLoud



### Scoring Utility Examples
