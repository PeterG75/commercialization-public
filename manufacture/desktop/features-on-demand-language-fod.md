### Language Features on Demand

**Recommendation:** Preinstall the relevant language capabilities for the languages you expect users in the device’s target market to need.

Language Features on Demand are available in seven types:

**Note:** Not all Features on Demand are available for every language.


| Component | Sample package name | Sample capability name  | Description |
| --------- | -----------|----- | ----------------------- |
| Basic     | `Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-Basic-fr-fr-Package.cab` | `Language.Basic~~~fr-FR~0.0.1.0`  | Spell checking, text prediction, word breaking, and hyphenation if available for the language.<br></br><p>You must add this component before adding any of the following components. <br></br><p>**Recommendation:** Preinstall the relevant language capabilities for the languages you expect users in the device’s target market to need.|
| Fonts     | `Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-Fonts-Thai-Package.cab` | `Language.Fonts.Thai~~~und-THAI~0.0.1.0` | Fonts.<br></br><p>**Recommendation:** If a PC will be sold to a certain region, install that region's Font (e.g., th-TH should be preinstalled on devices shipping to regions with Thai language).

| Optical character recognition | `Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-OCR-fr-fr-Package.cab` | `Language.OCR~~~fr-FR~0.0.1.0` | Basic | Recognizes and outputs text in an image.<br></br><p>**Recommendation:** Only install on devices required to be OCR-capable.

### <span id="Fonts"></span><span id="fonts"></span> Font Features on Demand

When adding languages for some regions, you'll need to add Features on Demand that add font support.

**Recommendation:** If a PC will be sold to a certain region, install that region's Font (e.g., th-TH should be preinstalled on devices shipping to regions with Thai language).
