# Add updates to a Windows image

For many customizations, like adding .inf-style drivers, Windows updates or upgrading the edition, you can mount and edit the Windows image. Mounting an image maps the contents of a file to a temporary location where you can edit the files or use DISM to perform common deployment tasks.

## Notes

-  **Add languages before major updates.** Major updates include hotfixes, general distribution releases, or service packs. If you add a language later, you'll need to re-add the updates.

-  **Add major updates before apps**. Thes apps include universal Windows apps and desktop applications. If you add an update later, you'll need to re-add the apps.

-  **For major updates, update the recovery image too**: These may include hotfixes, general distribution releases, service packs, or other pre-release updates. We'll show you how to update these later in [Lab 12: Update the recovery image](update-the-recovery-image.md).

-  **If a Servicing Stack Update (SSU) is available, you must install it** before applying the most recent General Distribution Release (GDR) or any future GDRs. See [Windows 10 update history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124/windows-10-update-history) to see the most recent GDR.


## Add a Windows update package to an image

1.  Get a Windows update package. For example, grab the latest cumulative update listed in [Windows 10 update history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history) from the [Microsoft Update catalog](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com). Extract the .msu file update to a folder, for example, C:\\WindowsUpdates\\windows10.0-kb4016871-x64_27dfce9dbd92670711822de2f5f5ce0151551b7d.msu.

    To learn more, see [https://myoem.microsoft.com/oem/myoem/en/product/winemb/pages/comm-ms-updt-ctlg-trnstn.aspx](https://myoem.microsoft.com/oem/myoem/en/product/winemb/pages/comm-ms-updt-ctlg-trnstn.aspx).    

2.  Add the updates to a [mounted](mount-and-modify-a-windows-image-using-dism.md) or online image. For packages with dependencies, make sure you install the packages in order. If you’re not sure of the dependencies, it’s OK to put them all in the same folder, and then add them all using the same DISM /Add-Package command by adding multiple /PackagePath items.

    **Example**: adding a cumulative update to a mounted image:

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\mount\windows" /PackagePath="windows10.0-kb4016871-x64_27dfce9dbd92670711822de2f5f5ce0151551b7d.msu"  /LogPath=C:\mount\dism.log
    ```

    **Example**: adding multiple updates:

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\mount\windows" /PackagePath="C:\WindowsUpdates\windows10.0-kb00001-x64.msu" /PackagePath="C:\WindowsUpdates\windows10.0-kb00002-x64.msu" /PackagePath="C:\WindowsUpdates\windows10.0-kb00003-x64.msu" /LogPath=C:\mount\dism.log
    ```

3.  Lock in the updates, so that they are restored during a recovery. 

    ```
    DISM /Cleanup-Image /Image:"C:\mount\windows" /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase /ScratchDir:C:\Temp
    ```

4.  Verify that the packages appear correctly:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /image:<path_to_image>
    ```

    Review the resulting list of packages and verify that the list contains the package. For example:

    ```
    Package Identity : Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~15063.250.1.1
    State : Installed
    Release Type : Security Update
    Install Time : 04/29/2017 6:26 PM

    The operation completed successfully.
    ```    

    > [!Note]
    > Each package will usually be a new KB, and will increase the build revision number of Windows on the device. The revision number of windows a device can be found in the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\UBR`.

5. If you're done updating your image, you can unmount it, committing changes.
