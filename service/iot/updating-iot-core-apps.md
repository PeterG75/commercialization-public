# Update apps on your Windows 10 IoT Core devices

OEMs and enterprise customers can deliver app updates to WindowsÂ 10 IoT Core devices in the following ways:

* **Using Microsoft Store**: The app is published and updated from the Microsoft Store
* **Using Device Update Center**: The app is published to Windows Update and updated like any other OEM package (driver package) *Coming soon*
* **Using Azure IoT Device Management**: The app is published to Azure Storage and updated through the Azure DM channel *New for Windows 10, version 1709*
* **Using OMA-DM**: The app is updated using an OMA-DM compliant device management channel such as Intune or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)

The first version of the app is always pre-packaged in the device during image time.
The [ApplicationManagement/AllowAllTrustedApps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#applicationmanagement-allowalltrustedapps) setting should be set for enabling installation of trusted apps.

## Using the Microsoft Store
The Microsoft Store provides unique and secure means to update the IoT Core apps, independent of the OS/OEM Component updates.
This option is interesting for OEMs who have:

* **High update frequency**: Expected to be update apps more frequently than the drivers.
* **Third-party ISV developers**: Third-party ISV developed app and managed with a different release schedule.

In this option, the apps that is pre-packaged needs to be Microsoft Store compliant apps (store signed). 

> [!Note]
> The Microsoft Store Client is not supported in Windows 10 IoT Core.

To learn more, see [Installing and Servicing apps on Windows 10 IoT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/commercialize-your-device/InstallingAndServicing)

### Managing Store app updates
The following settings on the device side control the updates from Windows Store.

* [ApplicationManagement/AllowStore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#applicationmanagement-allowstore): Enable/disable store.
* [ApplicationManagement/AllowAppStoreAutoUpdate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#applicationmanagement-allowappstoreautoupdate): Enable auto update of all store apps. 

#### Self updates
The Apps can be designed to control the updates by itself (either automatically or with user interaction with the appx). Windows makes available APIs that give a developer the ability to query available updates, download available updates and install available updates. 

See [Download and install package updates for your app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/self-install-package-updates) for more information on building this capability. In this case, the AllowAppStoreAutoUpdate should be disabled.

## Using Azure IoT Device Management 
[Azure IoT Device Management (AzureDM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/manage-your-device/azureiotdm) is a highly scalable management solution available on Windows 10 IoT Core. See [Application Management](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-core-azure-dm-client/blob/master/docs/application-management.md) for the details of installing and updating applications via AzureDM.

## Using OMA-DM
The OMA-DM interface is supported in Windows 10 IoT Core and any OMA-DM compliant management solution can be used to install and update applications. 
Read the documentation for [EnterpriseModernAppManagement CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/enterprisemodernappmanagement-csp) for usage instructions.
