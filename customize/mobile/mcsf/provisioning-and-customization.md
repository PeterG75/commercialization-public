# Customize using the mobile MCSF framework


The Managed Centralized Settings Framework (MCSF), which was introduced in Windows Phone 8.1, is supported in Windows 10.

MCSF consists of both image time and runtime components that enable a simple and consistent way of declaring OS settings, and a centralized framework that the runtime configuration engine, mobile operators, device management servers, and others can query or modify these settings. A runtime configurable MCSF can either be a configuration service provider-based customization or registry-based customization being exposed through the MSCF CSP.

Similar to the Unattend answer file that can be provided to Windows Setup for Windows Desktop image customization, a customization answer file can be passed to customize an image with specific settings and to create variants for the image. The customization answer file allows for a broader integration across the OS by providing OEMs with a single place to define nearly all OS settings. During image build time, the customization answer file is processed and built as customization packages, which are automatically included in the images. OEM partners can leverage this system by defining a registry or configuration service provider-based settings in packages using MCSF. MCSF also produces customization policy files for both OEM partners and Microsoft. These files are extracted from the packages used to build the OS image to determine the valid settings for the OS image.
