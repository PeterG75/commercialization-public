# Assigned access Windows PowerShell reference

Provides Windows PowerShell reference material for the Assigned access feature.

You can use assigned access to set up single-function devices, such as restaurant menus or displays at trade shows. If an account is configured for assigned access, a Windows app of your choosing runs above the lockscreen for the selected user account. Users of that account cannot access any other functionality on the device.

[Clear-AssignedAccess](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/assignedaccess/clear-assignedaccess)
Removes the user account from assigned access.

[Get-AssignedAccess](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/assignedaccess/get-assignedaccess)
Retrieves the current configuration for assigned access.

[Set-AssignedAccess](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/assignedaccess/set-assignedaccess)
Configures a user to only launch one application
