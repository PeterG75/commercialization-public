# Partner Guide to WSSD Certification


## <span id="Introduction"></span><span id="introduction"></span><span id="INTRODUCTION"></span>Introduction


Windows Server 2016 offers a range of competitive and differentiated capabilities to enable lower-cost, cloud scale Software-Defined Datacenter (SDDC) scenarios. The goal of the Windows Server Software-Defined (WSSD) program is to ensure that customers have a seamless deployment and steady-state operational experience on validated hardware. To that end, the WSSD program will provide guidance around four distinct technical stages:

-   **Design**: Reference architecture for configuration selection, design principles, and best practices
-   **Validate**: Additional SDDC tests to ensure components and systems meet WSSD requirements
-   **Deploy**: Initial deployment guidance with experience guides and scripts for automation
-   **Operate**: Experience guides for steady-state operational management using System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) and System Center Operations Manager (OM)
