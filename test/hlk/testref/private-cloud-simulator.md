# Private Cloud Simulator for Windows Server 2016


## <span id="Introduction"></span><span id="introduction"></span><span id="INTRODUCTION"></span>Introduction


The current industry trend is for private cloud solutions to comprise tightly integrated software and hardware components in order to deliver a resilient private cloud with high performance. Issues in any of the components (software, hardware, drivers, firmware, and so forth) can compromise the solution and undermine the promises made regarding a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the private cloud.

Some of these issues are surfaced only under a high-stress, cloud-scale deployment, and are potentially hard to find using traditional standalone, component-focused tests. The Private Cloud Simulator is a cloud validation test suite that enables you to validate your component in a cloud scenario and identify these types of issues.

## <span id="Test_Overview"></span><span id="test_overview"></span><span id="TEST_OVERVIEW"></span>Test Overview


Private Cloud Simulator (PCS) simulates a live datacenter/private cloud by creating VM workloads, simulating data center operations (load balancing, software/hardware maintenance), and injecting compute/storage faults (unplanned hardware/software failure). PCS uses a Microsoft SQL Server database to record test and solution data during the run. It then presents a report that includes operation pass/fail rates and logs whihch provide the capability to correlate data for pass/fail determination and failure diagnosis (as applicable).

### <span id="Topology"></span><span id="topology"></span><span id="TOPOLOGY"></span>Topology

Figure 1 shows the topology for a PCS lab environment with the following elements:

-   An Active Directory domain controller/DNS/DHCP server for the test domain.
-   A dedicated HLK controller machine.
-   A dedicated PCS controller machine.
-   A minimum 3-node (maximum nodes: 64) compute cluster, which hosts Hyper-V virtual machines.

![overall pcs topology](images/pcs-topology.png)

### <span id="Execution_Flow"></span><span id="execution_flow"></span><span id="EXECUTION_FLOW"></span>Execution Flow

PCS execution proceeds through the stages below. All stages after the PCS kickoff \[Stage (2)\] are fully automated and need no user intervention.

1.  Setup PCS lab topology
    1.  In this stage, the lab setup necessary for a succesful PCS run should be complete.
    2.  Section (2) discusses details on setting up the common lab infrastructure
    3.  Section (3) discusses the specific setups necessary for different types of devices/solutions.
2.  Kickoff PCS using HLK Studio
    1.  This stage kicks off the PCS execution process.
    2.  Section (3) discusses the HLK job(s) to be used to kick off PCS for different types of devices/solutions.
3.  Initialize PCS Controller (automated)
    1.  In this stage, the PCS execution engine sets up a SQL server and IIS on the PCS controller machine
    2.  It also copies content (e.g. evaluation OS VHD files) to enable VM creation in the next stage
4.  Create VMs (automated)
    1.  This stage sees the PCS engine start creating VMs on each node of the cluster
    2.  VM creation stops when the target number of VMs/node has been reached.
    3.  This step is a part of PCS setup phase. Test run duration timer kicks in post this stage.
5.  Run Actions (automated)
    1.  Now, PCS initiates various types of actions (VM, Cluster, Storage, Network) on each node of the cluster.
    2.  Actions run in parallel and co-ordinate among themselves to exercise the device (storage, network) and the solution through the private cloud/datacenter lifecycle
    3.  Actions run periodically and stop once the target execution time (defined by the profile/job) of the test has been reached.
    4.  Test execution time is defined per profile and can vary based on the profile you are running. Test execution timer kicks in after all the VMs are created.
    5.  The steps in each action and the corresponding result of each step is stored in the SQL server.
6.  Analyze Results (automated)
    1.  The Run Analyzer engine uses results stored on the SQL server to decide the result of the run based on the success rate of each action, the absence of unexpected crashes on the cluster node.
    2.  This result stored in the HLK logging format for use by HLK Studio.
7.  Cleanup Run (automated)
    -   In this stage, VMs created in stage (4) are cleaned up and the cluster is restored to a clean state (as possible).
8.  Report result in HLK Studio (automated)
    1.  In this stage, the HLK studio reports the result of the PCS run.
    2.  The result can be packaged into an HLKX file for submission to Microsoft.

## <span id="Common_Lab_Infrastructure_Setup"></span><span id="common_lab_infrastructure_setup"></span><span id="COMMON_LAB_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP"></span>Common Lab Infrastructure Setup


In this section, we will discuss the lab environment that will be common for all PCS execution.

### <span id="Topology"></span><span id="topology"></span><span id="TOPOLOGY"></span>Topology

The figure below shows the common topology for a PCS lab environment with the following elements:

1.  An Active Directory (AD) domain controller and DNS/DHCP servers for the test domain.
2.  A dedicated HLK controller
3.  A dedicated PCS controller

All the above machines (AD Controller, HLK Controller, PCS Controller) can be VMs and must be joined to the same test domain.

**User Credentials**

-   All PCS tests need to be run as the same user in the 'Domain Admins' group for the test domain.
-   Use the same user with Domain Admin credentials to install the HLK controller.

-   Follow the [Windows HLK Getting Started guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915002) to install HLK client software on all cluster nodes
-   Follow the [Windows Server 2016 Storage Spaces Direct cluster guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt693395.aspx) to deploy a cluster
-   10GbE or better networking bitrate is required for the NICs under test. Each server should have two identical 10gb or greater NICs.
-   All the nodes must be able to communicate with the PCS-Controller at all times through a management interface. For this purpose, each server should have one additional NIC for management interface, which does not need to meet strict bitrate requirements.
-   If RDMA capable NICs are used, the physical switch must meet the associated RDMA requirements.
-   Make sure that RDMA is setup on all nodes and reflects when queried through Get-SMBClientNetworkInterface & Get-SMBServerNetworkInterface.
-   Make sure that every node contains a teaming enabled virtual switch with the same name.

    Example: New-VMSwitch -Name SdnSwitch -NetAdapterName "SLOT 2,SLOT 2 2" -AllowManagementOS -EnableEmbeddedTeaming

-   Live Migration settings (Failover Cluster Manager-&gt;Networks-&gt;Live Migration Settings) must be set appropriately to use storage network for live migrations.

PCS will create virtual machines and send traffic between them using the virtual switch created. The vNic (virtual nic) of the PCS virtual machines are assigned IP address from the IP address space passed in as the AddressPrefixes parameter.

**PCS-Controller should be built as a Gen2-VM and have 2 network interfaces, one for the management network and the other for SDN (PA address space) topology.** The interface for SDN topology will be assigned an IP address from the IP address space passed in as the AddressPrefixes parameter.

StorageNodeDiskReadTimeoutAction
This action goes through disks that tolerate errors (not readonly, clustered, no simple spaces) and waits for read IO. Once an IO is intercepted, it will cause the IO to timeout. If a single timeout is detected on any disk, the action is considered successful.
StorageNodeDiskWriteTimeoutAction
This action goes through disks that tolerate errors (not readonly, clustered, no simple spaces) and waits for write IO. Once an IO is intercepted, it will cause the IO to timeout. If a single timeout is detected on any disk, the action is considered successful.
StorageNodeBusResetAction
This action attempts to inject a bus reset to any of the physical disks backing the pool. First, a timeout to a read or write IO is attempted, if that is successful then the corresponding abort, reset LUN, and reset target commands are failed. If any of these succeed then a bus reset will be triggered. If any disk issues a bus reset, the action is then considered successful.
StorageNodeUpdateStorageProviderCacheAction
Calls update-storageprovidercache command in powershell

### <span id="Actions"></span><span id="actions"></span><span id="ACTIONS"></span>Actions

The profile defines the actions to execute to validate the disk drives for Microsoft AzureStack. The table below lists the actions that are included in this profile.

Target object
Action
Description
Virtual machine
VmCloneAction
Creates a new VM.
VmLiveMigrationAction
Live-migrates the VM to another cluster node.
VmSnapshotAction
Takes a snapshot of the VM.
VmStateChangeAction
Changes the VM state (for example, to Paused).
VmStorageMigrationAction
Migrates VM storage (the VHD(s)) between cluster nodes.
VmGuestRestartAction
Restarts the VM.
VmStartWorkloadAction
Starts a user-simulated workload.
VmGuestFullPowerCycleAction
Power-cycles the VM.
Compute node
ClusterCSVMoveAction
Move the CSV disks to the best available node.
Storage node
StorageNodePoolMove
Moves a storage pool (created in Storage Spaces) to a different owner node in the storage cluster.
StorageNodeBusResetAction
This action attempts to inject a bus reset to any of the physical disks backing the pool. First, a timeout to a read or write IO is attempted, if that is successful then the corresponding abort, reset LUN, and reset target commands are failed. If any of these succeed then a bus reset will be triggered. If any disk issues a bus reset, the action is then considered successful.
StorageRetireAndRepairAction
This action retires a disk from a pool and starts repair. If spaces doesn't get healthy, the action fails. The action randomly picks a pool and tries to retire a disk in the pool. If the disk is set as readonly, or it is a simple space or is used for cluster purposes (i.e. quorum resource) then the action is skipped
 

**Duration**

-   PCS Actions (listed above) will run for 48 hours.
-   The complete run may take an additional 24-36 hours (including time for setup and cleanup).

While a PCS test pass is running, you can view and analyze data in real-time through SQL Server Reporting Services. After the test pass completes, you can get additional information in the logs generated by the PCS.

## <span id="realtime"></span><span id="REALTIME"></span>View PCS report in real-time through SQL Server Reporting Services


While PCS operations are running, reports are saved in a SQL database on the PCS Controller. Each report lists all operations that were performed, their pass percentages, and all resources that were acquired and released during the test. A new database is created for each test run to enable you to review data from previous test runs at any time.

To view the report, follow these steps:

1.  By default, Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled on Windows Server 2016. You need to disable it to view the report.

    Open Server Manager =&gt; Local Server =&gt; Click **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** to turn it off for administrators and users.

2.  Open IE from HLK controller and visit http://PcsControllerMachineName/Reports.

    If you open IE from PCS controller, you need to open IE with administrator privilege.

    ![pcs reporting page in internet explorer](images/pcs-ie-reports-page.png)

3.  Click **PCS Reports** =&gt; **PCSRuns**.
4.  Each PCS run is identified by a unique **Pass Run ID**.

    ![ie reporting showing pass run ids](images/pcs-ie-reports-pass-run-id.png)

5.  Click a **Pass Run ID** (for example, click f44b3f88-3dbf-476e-9294-9d479ca0a369) to open a report from the PCS run.

    The data in these reports is live. While a test runs, you can monitor the progress of a test run in real-time.

    -   An overview of all resources (VMs and hosts) that participated in the test run.
    -   All actions that were performed on each resource. The Pass and Fail columns report the number of actions that passed and failed.

    ![ie reporting showing run information](images/pcs-ie-reports-run-information.png)

6.  In the Overall Operation Information table, you can click links in the Action/Pass/Fail column to open detail pages, which give you more information about the action's results. For example, if you clicked the failure number 9 by the **VMLiveMigrationAction** entry, you would see the summary shown in the following illustration.

    ![ie reporting showing vmlivemigrationaction](images/pcs-ie-reports-vmlivemigrationaction.png)

    The first entry above provides the following information:

    -   **Failure ID:** When we encounter a failure in PCS, we generalize the Failure Message and generate a unique Hash for it. In above example the Failure ID is 97c12afd-23a8-3982-e304-a5dc6793950d
    -   **Failure Hash:** Generalized failure message.

        In the example above, the failure hash is the following:

        *Virtual Machine &lt;VIRTUAL MACHINE&gt; live migration failed at progress &lt;PERCENTAGE&gt; (migration state: Migrating)*

        *Error: Virtual machine migration operation for '&lt;VIRTUAL MACHINE&gt;' failed at migration destination '&lt;COMPUTE NODE&gt;'. (Virtual machine ID &lt;GUID&gt;)*

        *Failed to receive data for a Virtual Machine migration: This operation returned because the timeout period expired. (0x800705B4).*

    -   **Count Current Run:** The count of actions of a particular type that failed with this particular error message during this run. In the above example, **VMLiveMigrationAction** was run 3 times.
    -   **Count All Runs:** A count of actions that failed because of this particular failure across all PCS runs. For the **VMLiveMigrationAction**, this count was 3.
    -   **PCS Runs Affected:** Tells how many runs have been affected by this failure. For **VMLiveMigrationAction**, only 1 PCS run was affected.

7.  To look further into the error - you can click a failure ID on that screen to drill down to a global history of the failure type across all PCS runs. For example, click **97c12afd-23a8-3982-e304-a5dc6793950d** to display the following. The page lists all failed operations, grouped by failure type, which has the effect of highlighting key features that you might need to investigate.

    ![ie reporting showing failing actions by cause](images/pcs-ie-reports-failing-actions.png)

8.  If you click the Action ID, you can drill down farther to see an Action Log Report. Errors are shown in red; Warnings are shown in yellow.

    ![ie reporting showing action log report](images/pcs-ie-reports-action-log.png)

## <span id="Troubleshoot_a_PCS_run_from_the_PCS_Controller"></span><span id="troubleshoot_a_pcs_run_from_the_pcs_controller"></span><span id="TROUBLESHOOT_A_PCS_RUN_FROM_THE_PCS_CONTROLLER"></span>Troubleshoot a PCS run from the PCS Controller


There are multiple stages in PCS Execution Flow. If PCS failed at Setup, Execute, or Cleanup stage, you can browse job logs by right click the job name =&gt; click Browse Job Logs. The log file names are PCS-E2Elaunch\_Setup.log, PCSE2Elaunch\_Execute.log, and PCS-E2Elaunch\_Cleanup.log. Log files contain information about failures.

![pcs controller showing task execution status](images/pcs-task-execution-status.png)

When a PCS job fails, you can rerun Setup/Execute/Cleanup stage directly from PCS controller. This method is useful to for troubleshooting problems in these stages.

-   Open elevated command prompt
-   Run **ReRunPcsSetup.cmd**, **ReRunPcsExecute.cmd**, or **ReRunPcsCleanup.cmd** script

## <span id="Logs_and_Diagnose"></span><span id="logs_and_diagnose"></span><span id="LOGS_AND_DIAGNOSE"></span>Logs and Diagnose


PCS has three main stages: Setup, Execute, and Cleanup. HLK PCS job uses PCS-E2Elaunch.ps1 script to launch these three stages. Their log file names are called PCS-E2ELaunch\_Setup.log, PCS-E2ELaunch\_Execute.log and PCSE2ELaunch\_Cleanup.log.

When a PCS run has completed, PCS Run Analyzer analyzes logs and reports. The run succeeded when the following criteria are met, with the analyzed report saved as AnalyzerLog.log.

-   All PCS actions has 90% pass rate
-   No unexpected crash of any cluster node, except the ones initiated by PCS for testing purpose

The AnalyzerLog.log looks similar to the figure below:

![analyzer log](images/pcs-analyzer-log.png)

A zip file (PcsLog-DateTime.zip) is created at the end of PCS Cleanup phase. This file contains all the logs and is copied to the HLK PCS job result folder when a test fails.

-   ClusterLog subfolder: contains cluster log files
-   Events subfolder: contains event files
-   MHTML subfolder: contains SQL summary page and failed actions.
-   PCSEventData subfolder: contains workload logs
-   ClusterName-PRE.mht.html/ClusterName-POST.mht.html file: cluster validation test is run before and after PCS execute stage to verify the cluster healthy status

You can run the following script from PCS controller to generate a ZIP file that contains required logs. This method is useful when HLK Studio canceled the job before PCS Cleanup phase has finished.

**Syntax**

``` syntax
PS > C:\pcs\PCS-E2ELaunch.ps1 -DomainName <string> -UserName <string> -Password <string> -ComputeCluster <string> [-StorageCluster <string>] -CollectLog
```

**Parameters**

-   DomainName: Test user's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
-   UserName: Test user's user name
-   Password: Test user's password
-   ComputeCluster: Name of compute cluster name
-   StorageCluster: optional, Name of storage cluster name. Don't specify this parameter if Computer and Storage clusters are the same.
-   CollectLog: Required

While PCS is running, you can run the following cmdlets on PCS controller to generate a report that lists unexpected bugchecks from all nodes.

**Syntax**

``` syntax
PS > Import-Module .\PrivateCloudSimulator-Manager.psm1
```

``` syntax
PS > Get-PCSReport
```

The above cmdlet generates a HTM file containing the report.

### <span id="Customize_Action_Logs"></span><span id="customize_action_logs"></span><span id="CUSTOMIZE_ACTION_LOGS"></span>Customize Action Logs

A PCS run has a RunId. A PCS action has an action ID. When a PCS action fails, PCS removes the variant (i.e. VM name) from the failure message and generates a unique hash value for it. Similar failures have same unique hash value. PCS then groups them together in SQL report site.

PCS uses .NET Trace Listeners to collect test results. These listeners are defined in Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.exe.config.

-   SQLOnline: This listener logs the results into SQL database.
-   AnalyticalLogGather: This listener collects extra information when an action is failed.

When a particular action fails or a particular hash value is seen, you can configure AnalyticalLogGather listener to collect event logs, cluster logs, or call a script. This is defined in ActionFailureReactionPolicy.xml.

In ActionFailureReactionPolicy.xml, PCS supports two types of triggers and three types of reactions. Using this XML, you can define rules like "when trigger X is seen, take reactions Y and Z". Most actions would have NodeScope set to ReservedOnly and MaxLevel set to 3 (Critical, Error, and Warning events).

**Trigger:**

| Type         | Data           |
|--------------|----------------|
| ActionFail   | ActionFullName |
| KnownFailure | FailureHash    |

 

**Reaction:**

| Type                 | Data                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ETWCollection        | Channel, NodeScope, StorageLocation, MaxLevel                        |
| ClusterLogCollection | UseLocalTime, NodeScope, StorageLocation, MaxTimeDuration (optional) |
| CustomPS             | ScriptFullPath, NodeScope, Argument                                  |

 

Valid NodeScope values are the following:

-   AllNodes
-   ComputeOnly
-   StorageOnly
-   EdgeOnly
-   NCOnly
-   ReservedOnly

Valid MaxLevel values are the following:

-   0 (logs at all levels)
-   1 (Critical)
-   2 (Error)
-   3 (Warning)
-   4 (Information)
-   5 (Verbose)

**Examples:**

``` syntax

PCS by default uses the provided guest OS VHD to create VMs that have fixed disks by default. To create VMs that have differencing disks instead, set the UseDiffDisks value to true, as highlighted below:

**PrivateCloudSimulator.xml file:**

You can define and schedule your own actions for PCS to perform. Below shows a typical action definition in the **PrivateCloudSimulator.xml** file.

-   The value highlighted in yellow is the test name. This is the same test name that shows up on the report.
-   The **Interval** field sets the frequency with which the action runs. Use the format *hh:mm:ss*. For example, the value 02:00:00 repeats the action every 2 hours.
-   The **StartUpNumber** field defines the number of instances of that action to initiate on each node of the compute cluster.

***Where are HLK Studio and PCS controller installed?***

They are installed on additional machines that are not part of the cluster nodes.

![overall pcs topology](images/pcs-topology.png)

***Do we need to install the HLK Client on cluster nodes?***

You need to install HLK Client on cluster nodes and on the PCS controller as well.

***What additional configuration is needed to run firmware update action for disks?***

StorageNodeiskFirmwareRolloutAction depends on the following:

1.  XML File - FirmwareRolloutSettings.xml
2.  The firmware files
    -   XML File: Please create a file named **FirmwareRolloutSettings.xml** and copy it to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Hardware Lab Kit\Tests\amd64\PCS\StorageBin` on the HLK controller.

        The file should have the following format.

        ``` syntax
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <Data>
          <Table Id="Settings">
            <ParameterTypes>
              <ParameterType Name="Manufacturer">String</ParameterType>
              <ParameterType Name="Model">String</ParameterType>
              <ParameterType Name="TargetFirmwareVersion">String</ParameterType>
              <ParameterType Name="TargetFirmwarePath">String</ParameterType>
              <ParameterType Name="server">String</ParameterType>
            </ParameterTypes>
            <Row>
              <Parameter Name="Manufacturer">Manufacturer</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="Model">Model</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="TargetFirmwareVersion">Version1</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="TargetFirmwarePath">\\%HLKControllerName%\tests\amd64\PCS\StorageBin\V1.bin</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="BackupTargetFirmwareVersion">Version2</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="BackupTargetFirmwarePath">\\%HLKControllerName%\tests\amd64\PCS\StorageBin\V2.bin</Parameter>
              <Parameter Name="server">ServerNameWillBeUpdatedByTestAutomatically</Parameter>
            </Row>
          </Table>
        </Data>
        ```

    -   Copy the firmware files to a location/share on the HLK controller. This location should be accessible by the PCS controller and the cluster nodes.

        This location will be the **TargetFirmwarePath** in the XML above (e.g. \\\\%HLKControllerName%\\tests\\amd64\\PCS\\StorageBin)

***The small boot disk of cluster node has very little free space due to a large pagefile.***

By default, Windows sets the page file max size to the amount of system memory. It s located at C:\\pagefile.sys by default. Make sure your boot drive has enough free disk space on each cluster node. Otherwise, you should change the pagefile settings to reduce the size of it or move it to another drive.

You can run the following command to change the pagefile size. You'll need to then restart the machine.

Example: set the size to 10240MB

``` syntax
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v PagingFiles /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "C:\pagefile.sys 10240 10240" /f
```

***What is the PCS support alias?***

Please send email to [pvsha@microsoft.com](mailto://pvsha@microsoft.com) for any queries related to PCS or WSSD, AzureStack hardware certification.

The issues seen or resulting from a PCS certification run has been observed to not be related to PCS itself many times, as the PCS is a reliability test suite and touches a number of OS and third party components - HyperV, Clustering, Storage, Networking etc. to name a few.

The below are put together as a basic guide to help narrow down some of the issues:

-   Run cluster validation and check report for errors.
-   On the failover cluster manager, check whether all the nodes+vDisk+Pool are in healthy condition. If they are not, it is fine to invest time on checking the logs/debugging before calling upon MSFT.
-   Open Hyper-V manager and make sure the VMs and vSwitches get enumerated (also possible by running Get-VM or Get-VMSwitch).
-   Make sure you are able create a vSwitch outside of PCS tests on one/all of the compute nodes.
-   Make sure you can create a Win2012R2 VM on one/all of the nodes and can attach a vmNetworkAdapter it to a vSwitch.
-   Look for dump files generated due to bugchecks by running "dir /s \*.dmp" from the %systemdrive% on the compute nodes.
-   Possible usage of [LiveKD](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/livekd.aspx) to look at kernel modules/threads that are stuck, if you do not have kernel debugger attached.
-   Check if compute nodes' license is active, as Eval version license get reset every 180 days.
